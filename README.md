# Animated Glowing Button
This is a simple project that demonstrates how to create an animated glowing button using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

The button is designed with a gradient background and a border that gradually changes its color to create a glowing effect. When the user hovers over the button, the glowing effect becomes more pronounced, and the button scales up slightly to give a subtle interactive effect.
